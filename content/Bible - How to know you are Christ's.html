The experiential characteristics of those who have been anointed with the Holy Spirit includes continual and complete trust in the Son of God for the forgiveness of sins, keeping the teaching of God’s word in obedience to His commandments, personally sanctification according to God’s word and loving other believers. </span>Th<span class="T20">ese things</span> <span class="T20">are</span> the work and witness of the Holy Spirit of God. 1 John 5:7 states, “And it is the Spirit who bears witness, because the Spirit is the truth.” Th<span class="T20">ese things,</span> the work and the witness of the Holy Spirit in our lives, is the evidence that we are Christ's.</p><p class="P5"> </p><p class="P9">Those who are exhibiting these <span class="T25">experiential </span>characteristics <span class="T25">have assurance that they are</span> Christ’s.

However, the norm should be that one is regularly <span class="T22">and continually </span>exhibiting these characteristics, as they are indicative of fellowship with God. <span class="T27">Those that never exhibit these experiential characteristic should question whether they are the Lord’s. 1 John seems to indicate that those who have never exhibited these characteristics and in the future do not exhibit these </span><span class="T27">characteristics are not the Lord’s.</span></p><p class="P9"> </p><p class="P10">All of Christ’s have been sealed by the Holy Spirit to be God the Father’s, baptized by the Holy Spirit into the body of Christ, and are indwelt by the Holy Spirit at the moment of salvation. <span class="T24">Though these things are true of believers, not all believers exhibit the same spiritual growth. For some, they might only believe that Jesus is their Savior (the Christ) and confess significant transgressions without exhibiting much personal sanctification for a long period of time. These have not been baptized with God’s Spirit (are not being led by God’s Spirit, are not filled with the Spirit or producing the fruit of the Spirit), could still be Christ’s by virtue of the Spirit’s sealing, the Spirit putting them into the body Christ and the Spirits indwelling (that these believe that Jesus is their Savior and that they experience guilt for their sins is indicative that they are Christ’s).</span></p><p class="P9"> </p><p class="P9">Those who are Christ’s, know that they are His. <span class="T26">But, i</span>t is not for a believer to judge whether other<span class="T26">s</span> are Christ’s. We should examine our own lives. We can at best, pray for and warn others that they not deceive themselves, but we should not judge them, since only the Spirit of God knows who are Christ’s. We can warn others, that if they are not Christ’s, there is judgment, and if they are Christ’s but not in fellowship with God, there is God’s discipline and a loss of blessings here and in heaven.</p><p class="P4"> </p><p class="P3">Practical application</p><p class="P4"> </p><p class="P1">Believe that Jesus is the Son of God</p><div class="P13"><span class="T1">This trust in Jesus is the belief that saves, it is saving faith. John Calvin stated that “</span><span class="T4">faith is not simply the removal of all doubt or disturbance. Faith is not certainty. Saving faith has very little to do with the strength of our faith or our ability to conjure up mental images to remove all worries.
