# How to know if you are Christ's

It is possible for one to know that they have eternal life and that they
belong to Christ? 1 John 5:9-13 states, “... for the witness of God
is this, that He has borne witness concerning His Son. The one who
believes in the Son of God has the witness in himself … And the
witness is this, that God has given us eternal life, and this life is
in His Son. He who has the Son has eternal life … These things I
have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, in
order that you may know that you have eternal life.”

According
to this verse which is near the end of the book of 1 John, we are to
“believe in the name of the Son of God in order that you may know
that you have eternal life.”

- “Believe” is to continually and completely put one's trust in
   Him

- “The name of the Son of God” is to put our trust in who the Son
   of God is

- “These things” includes all that is written in the book of 1
   John

<u>Believe continually and<span class="ag-soft-line-break"></span>completely</u>

Biblical
belief is to trust in the Son of God for the forgiveness of sins.
Genuine belief is characterized by not only by knowledge or
intellectual consent, but by a continual and complete trust in the
Son of God.

The
trust is to be continual

- Col 1:23, “Yet He has now reconciled you in His fleshly body
   through death, in order to present you before Him holy and blameless
   and beyond reproach – if indeed you continue in the faith firmly
   established and steadfast, and not moved away in the hope of the
   gospel that you have heard ...”

- Isaiah 26:2-4, “Open the gates, that the righteous nation may
   enter, the one that remains faithful. The steadfast of mind Thou
   wilt keep in perfect peace, because he trusts in Thee. Trust in the
   LORD forever, for in God the LORD, we have an everlasting Rock.”

The
trust is to be complete, it is to believe Him completely. Even those
who have followed Him can stop believing in Him.

- John 6:29-69, “... “This is the work of God, that you believe in
   Him whom He has sent.” … “But I have said to you that you have
   seen Me, and yet do not believe … Jesus therefore said to them,
   “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son
   of Man and drink His blood, you have no life in yourselves … Many
   therefore of His disciples, when they heard this said, “This is a
   difficult statement; who can listen to it?” But Jesus, conscious
   that His disciples grumbled at this, said to them, “Does this
   cause you to stumble?” … “But there are some of you who do not
   believe” … As a result of this many of His disciples withdrew
   and were not walking with Him anymore. Jesus said therefore to the
   twelve, “You do not want to go away do you?” Simon Peter
   answered Him, “Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of
   eternal life. And we have believed and have come to know that you
   are the Holy One of God.””

<u>Trust in the name of<span class="ag-soft-line-break"></span>the Son of God</u>

We
are to trust in the being of the Son of God, that He is God, one with
the Father, and in all of the roles that the Father gave the Son of
God. 1 John 5 uses “Son of God” and not a title like “Christ”
or “Son of Man”. The name of the Son of God is One who has
compassion (Mark 9:36, 37) like the Father, authority and power (Mark
9:38, 39).

The Father, the Son
and the Spirit are One.[1](#sdfootnote1sym) The Son of the Living God has always had the essence of God, before
time began, after time began, during His incarnation and now at the
right hand of God (Is 48:16, “From the first I have not spoken in
secret, from the time it took place, I was there. And now the Lord
God has sent Me”).[2](#sdfootnote2sym) The expression “Son of God” is an eternal and immanent relation
of Christ to the Father.[3](#sdfootnote3sym) This also expresses His nature. His nature is that He is God as the
Son of God, as He has always been and shall always be. The Son of God
is equal in character and attributes as the Father, and He is also to
be equally worshiped as the Father.[4](#sdfootnote4sym) Being equal to the Father, the Son of God
has authority, and is the master and judge over all created things.

In
addition to who He is – the Son of God[5](#sdfootnote5sym),
He has been endowed with roles. “Jesus
Christ performed and shall perform (during the millennial kingdom)
three roles or functions - those of prophet (Deuteronomy 18:13-22),
priest (Psalm 110:1-4), and king (Psalm 2).”[6](#sdfootnote6sym) He has been glorified in these roles in
heaven as the Son of Man in the nature of God-man at the right hand of the throne of God.

<u>The things written in 1<span class="ag-soft-line-break"></span>John</u>

The
book of 1 John describes the characteristics of those who have
fellowship with God and are Christ's. Near the conclusion of the
book, the author states, “These things I have written to you who
believe in the name of the Son of God, in order that you may know
that you have eternal life.” The book describes the following
characteristics about those who are Christ's:

Believe that Jesus is the Son of God

- 1 John 5:1-12, “Whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is born
   of God; and whoever loves the Father loves the child born of Him …
   And the witness of God is this, that God has given us eternal life,
   and this life is in His Son. He who has the Son has life; he who
   does not have the Son of God does not have the life.”

Keep
to the truth of God's word to abide with God

- 1 John 2:18-29, “... But you
   have an anointing from the Holy One, and you all know … If what
   you heard from the beginning abides in you, you also will abide in
   the Son and in the Father … And as for you, the anointing which
   you received from Him abides in you, and you have no need for anyone
   to teach you, but His anointing teaches you about all things ...”

- 1 John 4:6, “We are from God; he who knows God listens to us; he
   who is not from God does not listen to us. By this we know the
   spirit of truth and of error.”

Obey
God's word

- 1 John 2:3-5, “By this we have come to know that we know Him, if
   we keep His commandments … but whoever keeps His word, in him the
   love of God has truly been perfected ...”

- 1 John 2:17, “And the world is passing away, and also its lusts,
   but the one who does the will of God abides forever.”

Personally
sanctified according to God's word

Practicing
righteous

- 1 John 3:7-10, “Little children, let no one deceive you; the one
   who practices righteousness is righteousness, just as He is
   righteousness … No one who is born of God practices sin, because
   His seed abides in him … By this the children of God and the
   children of the devil are obvious; anyone who does practice
   righteousness is not of God, nor the one who does not love his
   brother.”

Confession of sin

- 1 John 1:8-10, “If we say that we have no sin, we are deceiving
  ourselves and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, He is
  faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from
  all unrighteousness. If we say that we have not sinned, we make Him a
  liar and His word is not in us.”

Love other Christians

- 1 John 4:7-8, “Beloved, let us love one another, for love is from
   God; and everyone who loves is born of God and knows God. The one
   who does not love does not know God, for God is love.”

1
John states that those who are Christ's are characterized by a belief
in the Son of God that leads to a love for God by obeying His word.
This brings about a personal sanctification so that there is a
pattern of spiritual growth and purity in the individuals life. The
Christian is also characterized by a love for others who are
Christ's. This is the Law of Christ, that we love one another.

<u><b>Summary</b></u>

Those
who are Christians have been anointed with the Holy Spirit. The
anointing is both positional (have been sealed by the Holy Spirit to
be God the Father’s, baptized by the Holy Spirit into the body of
Christ, and are indwelt by the Holy Spirit at the moment of
salvation) and experiential (are led by God’s Spirit, are filled
with the Spirit or producing the fruit of the Spirit). The
experiential characteristics of those who have been anointed with the
Holy Spirit includes continual and complete trust in the Son of God
for the forgiveness of sins, keeping the teaching of God’s word in
obedience to His commandments, personally sanctification according to
God’s word and loving other believers. These things are the work
and witness of the Holy Spirit of God. 1 John 5:7 states, “And it
is the Spirit who bears witness, because the Spirit is the truth.”
These things, the work and the witness of the Holy Spirit in our
lives, is the evidence that we are Christ's.

Those
who are exhibiting these experiential characteristics have assurance
that they are Christ’s. There could be periods of time, even large
periods of time that a person is not exhibiting these
characteristics, but is still Christ’s. Perhaps it could be that
only early on in one’s life and late in one’s life that one
exhibits these characteristics. However, the norm should be that one
is regularly and continually exhibiting these characteristics, as
they are indicative of fellowship with God. Those that never exhibit
these experiential characteristic should question whether they are
the Lord’s. 1 John seems to indicate that those who have never
exhibited these characteristics and in the future do not exhibit
these characteristics are not the Lord’s.

All
of Christ’s have been sealed by the Holy Spirit to be God the
Father’s, baptized by the Holy Spirit into the body of Christ, and
are indwelt by the Holy Spirit at the moment of salvation. Though
these things are true of believers, not all believers exhibit the
same spiritual growth. For some, they might only believe that Jesus
is their Savior (the Christ) and confess significant transgressions
without exhibiting much personal sanctification for a long period of
time. These have not been baptized with God’s Spirit (are not being
led by God’s Spirit, are not filled with the Spirit or producing
the fruit of the Spirit), could still be Christ’s by virtue of the
Spirit’s sealing, the Spirit putting them into the body Christ and
the Spirits indwelling (that these believe that Jesus is their Savior
and that they experience guilt for their sins is indicative that they
are Christ’s).

Those
who are Christ’s, know that they are His. But, it is not for a
believer to judge whether others are Christ’s. We should examine
our own lives. We can at best, pray for and warn others that they not
deceive themselves, but we should not judge them, since only the
Spirit of God knows who are Christ’s. We can warn others, that if
they are not Christ’s, there is judgment, and if they are Christ’s
but not in fellowship with God, there is God’s discipline and a
loss of blessings here and in heaven.

<u><b>Practical<span class="ag-soft-line-break"></span>application</b></u>

<u>Believe that Jesus is<span class="ag-soft-line-break"></span>the Son of God</u>

This
trust in Jesus is the belief that saves, it is saving faith. John
Calvin stated that “faith
is not simply the removal of all doubt or disturbance. Faith is not
certainty. Saving faith has very little to do with the strength of
our faith or our ability to conjure up mental images to remove all
worries. But saving faith is “a steady and certain knowledge of the
divine benevolence towards us.””[7](#sdfootnote7sym)

- “Faith
   is trusting that Christ will be faithful even in the times when
   we’re not faithful to Him.”[8](#sdfootnote8sym)

- “Faith
   is resting in the fact that God loves and enjoys us.”[9](#sdfootnote9sym)

- The
   faith is in the Son of God, not faith in our faith. “Faith is
   trusting in Christ instead of trusting in ourselves to trust in
   Christ. There is a huge difference between the two. One looks
   upward, the other looks inward.”[10](#sdfootnote10sym)

<u>Know the truth of God's<span class="ag-soft-line-break"></span>word, obedience to the word of God and personal sanctification</u>

The
word of God is central to the Christian life. In it is revealed the
character of God, the love of God, the work of God and the
commandments of God. The knowledge of and the obedience to the
commandments of God are necessary for the practice of righteousness
and personal sanctification. Obedience to the word leads to personal
sanctification. The personal sanctification should reveal the life of
Christ in us and through us. Obedience to the Law of Christ is that
we love one another. This personal sanctification and love for one
another cannot be imitated through legalism. It is all the work of
His Spirit. His Spirit will manifest His people to each other and the
world.

There
should be a point in ones life that personal sanctification begins
and it should continue throughout ones life, though there might be
periods of regression or what appears to be little or no personal
sanctification. This
seems to be consistent with 2 Tim 2:19 which states, “Nevertheless,
the firm foundation of God stands, having this seal, “The Lord
knows those who are His,” and, “Everyone who names the name of
the Lord is to abstain from wickedness.””

It
is my opinion, that in the taking of communion

- Motives should be considered. A person should ask themselves the
   following
  
  - Are they living according to the written word of God. If so, then
     communion should be taken as often as possible. (1 Cor 11:24-26)
  
  - Are they in active sin or passive indifference. If so, then they
     should confess their sin or lack of interest in the things of God,
     and take communion. (1 Cor 11:28, 1 John 1:9)
  
  - Are they in continual active sin. If so, then they should refrain
     from communion until they have repented of their sin before taking
     communion. (1 Cor 11:28-34, 1 John 2:1-3)
  
  - Have they been continually passively indifferent and have been
     continually irregular concerning the things of God. If so, then
     they should refrain from taking communion and consider whether they
     are the Lord's.

<u>Love<span class="ag-soft-line-break"></span>other Christians</u>

Those
who are the Lord's want to fellowship with other believers (1 John
1:3), love one another by meeting each others practical needs
(3:17,18) and also spiritually
intercede for other believers (1 John 5:16).

 26:63-64., “I adjure you by the living God, that You tell us
 whether You are the Christ, the Son of God.” Jesus said to him,
 “You have said it yourself, nevertheless I tell you, hereafter you
 shall see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power, and
 coming on the clouds of heaven.” Jesus calls himself the Son of
 Man (in reference to the Divine Being in Daniel 7:13,14) and the Son
 of God. Thus, in both acknowledging that He is the Son of God and
 also the Divine reference in Daniel 7, He is conclusively stating
 that He is Divine.

In Acts 7:56, Steven said that “Behold,
 I see the heavens opened up and the Son of Man standing at the right
 hand of God.” In Math 24:30 and 25:31, Jesus said that “they
 will see the Son of Man arriving on the clouds of heaven with power
 and great glory” and “When the Son of Man comes in His glory and
 all His angels with Him, then He will sit on His glorious throne.”
 The Son of God is sitting at the right and of the throne of God as
 the glorified Son of Man.
